## About AXI Lite and AXI Full

The AXI Lite protocol is a lightweight subset of the full AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) protocol designed for simple, low-throughput control register access. Unlike AXI Full, which supports burst transactions and higher data throughput, AXI Lite handles single data transfers and is ideal for register-mapped peripherals with simpler requirements.

## Design Overview

This project implements a fully protocol-compliant AXI Lite Slave Interface in Verilog RTL. It features:

- Separate read and write address channels
- Full handshake support
- Address decode for multiple slave registers
- Response generation for invalid transactions

## RTL elaborated image
